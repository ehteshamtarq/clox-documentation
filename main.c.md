## 1. int main(int argc, const char *argv[]):
- The main function takes two parameters:
- - argc: The number of arguments passed to the program, including the program's name.
- - argv[]: An array of strings (character pointers) representing the arguments. argv[0] is the name of the program, and any other arguments follow.
- The program operates based on how many arguments are passed (argc).
