A Pratt parser is a type of top-down operator precedence parser used to parse expressions, especially those that involve operators with different precedence and associativity. The parser was introduced by Vaughan Pratt in 1973 and is known for its simplicity and flexibility. It works well with expressions commonly found in programming languages, like arithmetic expressions, where operators have different levels of precedence (e.g., +, *, /).

Key Concepts of a Pratt Parser
Tokens: A Pratt parser reads a sequence of tokens (symbols) from the input. These tokens can be operators, operands, or other language constructs.

Left and Right Binding Powers:

Left Binding Power (LBP): Determines how strongly a token binds to the tokens on its left.
Right Binding Power (RBP): Determines how strongly a token binds to the tokens on its right.
These powers help in resolving precedence between operators (e.g., multiplication has higher precedence than addition).
Nud (Null Denotation) and Led (Left Denotation) Functions:

Nud (Null Denotation): Handles tokens that appear at the start of an expression (e.g., numbers, parentheses, unary operators). It describes how the parser should interpret a token when it is the first token in an expression.
Led (Left Denotation): Handles tokens that appear in between other tokens (e.g., binary operators like + and *). It describes how the parser should interpret a token when it follows another token.
Recursive Parsing:

The parser starts with the lowest precedence level and recursively parses sub-expressions with higher precedence until it reaches the end of the expression or a token with a lower binding power.
Pratt Parsing Algorithm Steps
Tokenize Input: The input expression is tokenized into a list of tokens (e.g., 3 + 4 * 2 becomes [3, +, 4, *, 2]).

Parse Expressions:

Start by calling a function like parse_expression(min_binding_power), where min_binding_power is the minimum binding power allowed for the current expression.
The function examines the current token and decides how to handle it using its nud or led function, depending on whether it's at the start or follows another token.
Apply nud and led Functions:

The nud function is called if the current token starts a new sub-expression.
After parsing the left-hand side (LHS), if the next token is a binary operator, its led function is called to parse the right-hand side (RHS).
Resolve Operator Precedence and Associativity:

While parsing, the parser uses the binding powers to resolve which sub-expressions belong together, ensuring correct precedence and associativity are applied.
Build the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):

As the expression is parsed, an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is constructed, representing the structure of the expression based on operators, operands, and their precedence.
Example: Parsing "3 + 4 * 2"
Consider the expression 3 + 4 * 2:

Start Parsing:

The first token is 3, which is a number. It calls nud and returns 3.
Encounter + Operator:

The next token is +. It has a left binding power of 10 and calls led to parse the expression on its right side with a minimum binding power of 10.
Parse Right Side of +:

The next token is 4, which is a number. It calls nud and returns 4.
Encounter * Operator:

The next token is *. It has a higher precedence than + (left binding power of 20), so it continues parsing the expression on its right side with a minimum binding power of 20.
Parse 2:

The next token is 2, which is a number. It calls nud and returns 2.
Build the AST:

The * operator binds more strongly than +, so it forms a sub-expression 4 * 2.
Finally, the + operator combines 3 and 4 * 2 to form the full expression.
